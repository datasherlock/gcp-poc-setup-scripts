# Setup scripts for quick POCs 

This repository contains all the source code I've written to setup infrastructure, generate test data, perform benchmarks and other repetetive actions that are required through the course of learning a technology or while working with a customer. I've categorized the repository by the primary service/technology.  

While a lot of the infrastructure provisioning can be accomplished through Terraform, it isn't the most feasible approach while we are in the early stages of trying and testing out stuff. So, a lot of the code will be stuff you can directly run on a terminal or using Python.

I would be happy to receive any snippets you may have to contribute if it aligns with the overall goal of this project. 

Happy coding!
